fs-gram-schmidt 
===============================
Feature Ranking and Selection Using Gram Schmidt Orthogonalisation  

fs-gram-schmidt is an open-source feature selection algorithm in Python. It is built upon scientific computing packages Numpy and Scipy.
It is based on the paper [**Ranking a Random Feature for Variable and Feature Selection** (Stoppiglia et al. 2003)](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/v3/stoppiglia03a.html) published in Journal of Machine LEarning Research
